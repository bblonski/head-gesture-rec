This uses efficient image processing techniques to preform real-time head gesture recognition for computer control.  Gestures use an event based architecture which may be handled in external programs.

This project was developed in Visual Studio 2008 on the Windows platform, but should be portable to Linux and Mac with a little work.  This project requires OpenCV.

This project was initially developed for the thesis [THE USE OF CONTEXTUAL CLUES IN REDUCING FALSE POSITIVES IN AN EFFICIENT VISION-BASED HEAD GESTURE RECOGNITION SYSTEM](http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/295)
